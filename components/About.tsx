        My journey in the tech world began over 5 years ago in the realm of QA
        and QA automation. While ensuring software quality, I discovered my true
        passion for coding and building user-centric interfaces.
        <span className="italic">My favorite part of programming</span> is the
        problem-solving aspect. I <span className="underline">love</span> the
        feeling of finally figuring out a solution to a problem. My core stack
        is{' '}
        <span className="font-medium">React, Typescript, Redux, Next.js</span>.
        I am always looking to learn new technologies. I am currently looking

        <span className="italic">Beyond the screen</span>, I'm a fitness
        enthusiast who loves hitting the gym â€“ finding parallels between pushing
        my limits in the code and in the weight room. I enjoy playing video
        games, watching movies, and playing with my dog. I also enjoy{' '}

        and sense of wonder.
